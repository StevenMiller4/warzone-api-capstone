# Call of Duty: Warzone Profile Tracker

A basic API Capstone that allows the user to enter a Profile name and Platform for the game, Call of Duty: Warzone, and retrieve statistics on kills, deaths, wins, placements, score, and more.

## Motivation

There are very little resources available to track your profile outside of being in game. With as popular as Warzone is - and how competitive it is in nature - having a third-party tool to track stats could be very helpful in gauging success.
